Hello! My name is Leonard Melnik. Today I will show you how to make your own radio station with only 10 dollars of things! The first step is to make an antenna.
What you will need for this project is the $ 5 raspberry pi.

You can use any cable. But I will use a small and

Once you have your cable, put it in hole number four of the Raspberry pi.

Now we need to make it work. Go to https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ and put it on your card.

Then, place the card in the raspberry pi and turn it on. If you are not using a monitor and a keyboard for the Raspberry Pi you will
need to connect to it using SSH. Which is like TeamViewer for commands (just an easy description). You will need to plug your Raspberry Pi
into some kind of internet connection. For this I used a micro-usb to ethernet adapter. This allows for us to install the software we need
and later on

Commands to do:
git clone https://github.com/rm-hull/pifm
cd pifm
sudo make
sudo apt-get update 

So we want the thing to help us play the music, so do this:

sudo apt-get install mpg123

Put this in a file called rc.local

sudo /usr/bin/mpg123 -4 -s -Z /home/pi/Music/ * | sudo /home/pi/pifm/pifm - 88.3

Finally do this to turn on your radio! But you have to choose your songs! I chose to put some songs in Spanish.

Now, when you want to listen, simply power the radio and now you can listen to your music.
